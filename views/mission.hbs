                <p class="fam-card-description">We hold a mentorship program called <a href="/families">HogWATTs</a> for incoming EE students. We also have activites open to all general members including: <a href="/projects">tinkering workshops</a>, social atmosphere talks, and outreach (to other engineering majors and K - 12 students). Every workshop is beginner friendly and members will have the freedom for creativity. Members will learn basic circuits, career tips, and managing a healthy school life balance. Join if you want to inspire others, tinker with EE and network with industry professionals.</p>
                <p class="fam-card-description">Our organization is supported by UCLA's <a href="http://www.ee.ucla.edu/">ECE Department</a> and Faculty Advisor Professor Dennis Briggs. </p>
